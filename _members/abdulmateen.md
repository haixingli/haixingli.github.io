Abdul Mateen Hassan is a Master’s student in Physics at the City University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of Dr. Haixing Li. He earned his B.S. (Hons) in Physics from the University of Gujrat, Pakistan in 2018, and recently completed his M.Phil in Physics from Abbottabad University of Science and Technology in 2024 with a strong CGPA of 3.85/4.00, specializing in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics. As first author, he has published two peer-reviewed research papers in Physics Letters A, investigating Zitterbewegung — the quantum trembling motion of electrons — in 2D materials like silicene and tungsten disulfide under magnetic fields. His work explores how quantum revivals and radiated electromagnetic fields in these systems can serve as probes for topological phase transitions and quantum coherence, with potential applications in future quantum technologies. Outside the lab, he enjoys hiking and playing table tennis to unwind and stay active.
