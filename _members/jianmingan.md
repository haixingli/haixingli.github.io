  where he spent his time to develop photodetectors in optical image recognition with
  [Prof. Xuebo Yang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/yangxuebo).
  He later completed his M.Sc. degree in Optical Engineering from Dalian Polytechnic University with
  [Prof. H. Lin](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Hai-Lin-2037650051) and
  [Prof. D.S. Li](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Desheng-Li-2084819246) and
