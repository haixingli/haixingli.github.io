Haixing Li obtained her B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China
in 2012 where she did her undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Xianhui Chen](https://chenxh.ustc.edu.cn/index.html) growing oxides in search of superconductors. During her undergraduate studies, she also spent a summer at the University of Oxford
learning quantum optics. She then moved to Columbia University and earned her Ph.D. in Applied Physics
in 2017 under the guidance of [Prof. Latha Venkataraman](https://www.venkataramangroup.org) uncovering
electronic properties of molecular silicon.
She worked as a postdoctoral fellow and later a Charles H. Revson Senior Fellow in the laboratory of [Prof. Ruben Gonzalez](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html) at Columbia University studying
mechanisms of ribosomal frameshifting from 2017 to 2021.
Haixing Li is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics at City University of Hong Kong.
Courses that she taught at CityUHK include General Physics III, Physics in Medicine, and Advanced Imaging Physics. Currently she is teaching Statistical Mechanics and Advanced Measurement and Instrumentation.
