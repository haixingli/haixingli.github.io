My name is Shaarib, and I am currently a final-year physics major with a minor in neuroscience at City University of Hong Kong. I have a deep passion for experimental physics and aspire to pursue higher studies, with the goal of contributing to academia. My research interests include molecular electronics, quantum conductance, nanoscale materials, and areas of space physics and astrophysics, as I am fascinated by both the microscopic and cosmic scales of the physical universe. My Final Year Project explores conductance in nitro molecules, allowing me to engage in hands-on experimentation and further develop my understanding of molecular behavior in electronic systems.
