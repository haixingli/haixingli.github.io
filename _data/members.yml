  description: "Haixing Li obtained her B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China
  in 2012 where she did her undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Xianhui Chen](https://chenxh.ustc.edu.cn/index.html) growing oxides in search of
  superconductors. During her undergraduate studies, she also spent a summer at the University of Oxford
  learning quantum optics. She then moved to Columbia University and earned her Ph.D. in Applied Physics
  in 2017 under the guidance of [Prof. Latha Venkataraman](https://www.venkataramangroup.org) uncovering
  electronic properties of molecular silicon.
  She worked as a postdoctoral fellow and later a Charles H. Revson Senior Fellow in the laboratory of [Prof.
  Ruben Gonzalez](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html) at Columbia University studying
  mechanisms of ribosomal frameshifting from 2017 to 2021.
  Haixing Li is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics at City University of Hong Kong.
  Courses that she teaches at CityU include General Physics III, Physics in Medicine, and Advanced Imaging Physics."

  description: "Bangyao grew up in Zhejiang, China. He obtained his B.Sc. in Polymer Materials and Engineering from
  Tianjin University of Science and Technology (2019). He completed his M.Sc. in Materials Engineering from Southern University
  of Science and Technology (2021) for thermal energy application on diatoms-based phase change materials in the
  group of Prof. Dazhi Sun. Then he spent a brief time as a research assistant in the Department of Materials Science
  and Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology. After that, with passion and self-motivation,
  he decided to pursue a Ph.D. in the Department of Physics at CityU, Hong Kong. In the Li lab, his research interests
  focus on exploring molecular electronics by external stimuli. Outside of the laboratory, Bangyao enjoys playing
  basketball, photography and biking. Go-go-go, letâ€™s play together."

  description: "J.M. An was born and raised in China. He received his B.Sc. in Automation from Bohai University,
  where he spent his time to develop photodetectors in optical image recognition with
  [Prof. Xuebo Yang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/yangxuebo).
  He later completed his M.Sc. degree in Optical Engineering from Dalian Polytechnic University with
  [Prof. H. Lin](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Hai-Lin-2037650051) and
  [Prof. D.S. Li](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Desheng-Li-2084819246) and
  developed a love for luminescence with rare earth elements.
  During his graduate studies, he spent a brief time as a research assistant in Research Institute of Photonics
  and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences with [Prof. G. Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0017031) and Prof. D.S. Li.
  He then moved to Hong Kong to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics working at City University of Hong Kong, China.
  He is looking forward to integrating his optical science background with molecular electronics in the laboratory
  of Dr. Haixing Li. Outside of lab, he enjoys playing saxophone, cracking software and making RPG games by UE4."
