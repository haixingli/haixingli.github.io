WELCOME TO THE LI LAB IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS AT CITY UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG.

The Li Lab examine biomolecules and bio-inspired architectures at the single molecule level to spark advances in electronics, health,
and sustainability. By applying physics approaches centered around single molecule techniques onto a variety of synthetic and biological molecules,
our lab aim to uncover the underlying chemical principles and
ultimately design and create novel functionalities that harness molecular properties.
