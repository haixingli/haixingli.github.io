The Li lab examine biomolecules and bio-inspired architectures at the single molecule level to spark advances in electronics, health,
and sustainability. Through efficient characterization at the single molecule level, we can achieve a fundamental understanding of
structure-function relationship of the molecular materials. By applying physics approaches centered around single
molecule techniques onto a variety of synthetic and biological molecules, our lab aim to uncover the underlying chemical principles and
ultimately design and create novel functionalities that harness molecular properties.
